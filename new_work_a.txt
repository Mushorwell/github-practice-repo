This is a new file that has been added to the branch_a of the repository. 

This file will not have any useful or interesting content besides this fact.

(update): This file has now been staged and is going to be submitted to this new branch. 

By the way, did you know that if you accidentally delete a folder that is also a working directory for git, you can never retrieve those files ever, unless they have been sent to the recycle bin or you have pushed to the remote repository. 

Well, now you know. Seems like this file will have some useful information after all. Maybe not a story, but something worth noting.
